# README

This is an example of how to use Rails delegated types in your app. 

This pulls from examples DHH has shared on his series, ["On Writing Software Well"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i1gdwe1Ls&list=PL3m89j0mV0pdNAg6x9oq6S8Qz_4C-yuwj), and [Javan's conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmWlm0M6JSk).

It's been fun learning more about this pattern.

I hope this repo is useful to you.
