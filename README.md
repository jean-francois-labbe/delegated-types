# README

This is an example of how to use Rails delegated types in your app. 

This pulls from examples DHH has shared on his series, ["On Writing Software Well"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i1gdwe1Ls&list=PL3m89j0mV0pdNAg6x9oq6S8Qz_4C-yuwj), and [Javan's conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmWlm0M6JSk).

It's been fun learning more about this pattern.

To get started, run `bundle install` to install gem dependencies.

Next, create your database and run the migrations with `rails db:create db:migrate.`

Finally, run `yarn install` to install javascript dependencies.

From there, you can create an account and view the todolists and todo paradigm. 

If you have any ideas for extending this and making it better, please create a pull request!
